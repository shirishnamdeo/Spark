ORCFileFormat (Internals):

Optimized Row Columnar File System

-- Initially developed by Horton Works for Hive 

-- Hive has Vectorized ORC Reader, which acknowledge the indices.

-- ORC always produces a single output file out of each task, and thus reduces the load of NameNode.



ORC file componets:
	Stripes
		-- Default size 250 MB
		-- Large stripes sizes enable large, efficient reads from HDFS

		Stripes Cotains:
			Index Data - Contains Min, Max values of each column, and row position of each column
			Row Data - is the data for the indexed rows
			Stripes Footer


	File Footer
		-- Metadata of Stripes, like 
			list of Stripes in file
			no of rows per stripe
			each column's data type,
			Column Level aggregates Count (of number of rows in a particular stripe)

	Postscript
		-- holds compression parameters
