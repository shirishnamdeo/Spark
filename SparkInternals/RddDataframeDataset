Spark DataFrame (Spark 1.3+):
	DataFrames gives a schema view of data basically, it is an abstraction. 
	In dataframes, view of data is organized as columns with column name and types info. 
	In addition, we can say data in dataframe is as same as the table in relational database.




Spark Dataset (Spark 1.6+):
	In Spark, datasets are an extension of dataframes.
	Datasets offers compile-time type safety. (Ex, Will give an error at compile time if an column is not present or type-mismatch)

	Because of using spark SQL engine, it auto discovers the schema of the files. ***??? How?
